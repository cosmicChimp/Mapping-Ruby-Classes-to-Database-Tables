# Mapping-Ruby-Classes-to-Database-Tables

-In order to "map" this Song class to a songs database table, 
    we need to create our database, then we need to create our songs table. 
    In building an ORM, it is conventional to pluralize the name of the class to create the name of the table. 
    Therefore, the Song class equals the "songs" table.
